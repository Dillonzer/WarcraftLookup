# WarcraftLookup
A Discord bot for looking up info on multiple World of Warcraft integrations

## Future Ideas:

!armory <name>
!tankmeta
Outputs a list of all tanks, with % representation in both raid and M+
!healermeta 
same as tankmeta
!meleemeta
!rangemeta

!<spec> <lookup> <boss/dungeon> <difficulty(optional)>

Where Spec = Guardian, Windwalker, Subtility etc
Where Lookup = Talents, Trinkets, Weapon etc
Where Boss/dungeon = Tindral Sageswift, Halls of Infusion etc
Where Difficulty = Normal, Heroic, Plus10, Plus13 etc
